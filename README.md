# Predicting Market Capitalization of S&P 500 Companies Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the **market capitalization** of companies in the **S&P 500 index** using real-time financial data scraped from Yahoo Finance. By applying and comparing multiple machine learning models, the study explores the effectiveness of **ensemble learning**, **regularization**, and **support vector regression** in financial forecasting.
